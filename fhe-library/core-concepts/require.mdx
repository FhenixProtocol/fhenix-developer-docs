## Overview

The `require` statement in FHE contracts works similarly to [Conditions (if .. else)](/fhe-library/core-concepts/conditions) because both involve conditional logic on encrypted data. Just as you can't use traditional `if...else` statements with encrypted values, you also can't directly use `require` statements with encrypted booleans.

<Warning>
Traditional `require` statements cannot evaluate encrypted conditions directly. You must decrypt the condition first or use alternative patterns.
</Warning>

## Why Require is Similar to Conditions

Both `require` and conditional statements face the same fundamental challenge in FHE:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Encrypted Evaluation" icon="lock">
The condition being checked is encrypted, so the contract cannot directly evaluate whether it's true or false.
</Card>

<Card title="No Direct Branching" icon="code-branch">
Both require branching logic that reveals information about encrypted data, which breaks FHE's privacy guarantees.
</Card>
</CardGroup>

## Working with Require in FHE

To use `require` with encrypted conditions, you must first decrypt the condition. This should only be done when the result can be safely revealed:

```solidity
// Decrypt the encrypted boolean before using in require
ebool encryptedCondition = value.gt(threshold);
bool condition = FHE.decrypt(encryptedCondition);

require(condition, "Condition not met");
```

<Note>
Only decrypt conditions when revealing the result doesn't compromise privacy. For internal logic that must remain private, use `FHE.select` instead as shown in the [Conditions (if .. else)](/fhe-library/core-concepts/conditions) guide.
</Note>
