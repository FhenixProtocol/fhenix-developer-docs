## Overview

The `require` statement in FHE contracts works similarly to [Conditions (if .. else)](/fhe-library/core-concepts/conditions) because both involve conditional logic on encrypted data. Just as you can't use traditional `if...else` statements with encrypted values, you also can't directly use `require` statements with encrypted booleans.

<Warning>
Traditional `require` statements cannot evaluate encrypted conditions directly. You must decrypt the condition first or use alternative patterns.
</Warning>

## Why Require is Similar to Conditions

Both `require` and conditional statements face the same fundamental challenge in FHE:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Encrypted Evaluation" icon="lock">
The condition being checked is encrypted, so the contract cannot directly evaluate whether it's true or false.
</Card>

<Card title="No Direct Branching" icon="code-branch">
Both require branching logic that reveals information about encrypted data, which breaks FHE's privacy guarantees.
</Card>
</CardGroup>

## Working with Require in FHE

Since decryption is asynchronous, you cannot use traditional `require` statements with encrypted conditions in the same transaction. Instead, simulate the behavior by using encrypted zero when conditions fail:

```solidity
// Check if user has sufficient balance
ebool hasSufficientBalance = userBalance.gte(amount);

// If condition fails, use encrypted zero; otherwise use the actual amount
euint32 transferAmount = FHE.select(hasSufficientBalance, amount, FHE.asEuint32(0));

// Process the transfer (will be zero if condition wasn't met)
userBalance = userBalance.sub(transferAmount);
recipientBalance = recipientBalance.add(transferAmount);
```

<Note>
This pattern simulates transaction invalidation by using encrypted zero when conditions aren't met, effectively making the operation a no-op while maintaining constant-time execution and privacy.
