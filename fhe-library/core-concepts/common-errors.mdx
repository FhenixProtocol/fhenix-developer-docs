## Overview

This page documents critical limitations and important considerations when working with CoFHE. Understanding these common issues and error messages will help you troubleshoot problems and build more robust FHE-enabled smart contracts.

<Warning>
Always verify you're using compatible component versions. Many errors can be resolved by ensuring you're using the latest versions of all CoFHE components.
</Warning>

## Common Issues

### Missing Revert Data

If you encounter a `Missing revert data` error, verify that you're using the latest `cofhe-contracts` version.

<Steps>
<Step title="Check your version">
Verify the version of `cofhe-contracts` in your project:

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npm list @fhenixprotocol/cofhe-contracts
```

```bash yarn
yarn list --pattern "@fhenixprotocol/cofhe-contracts"
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm list @fhenixprotocol/cofhe-contracts
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>

<Step title="Compare with compatibility guide">
Check the [Compatibility](/get-started/introduction/compatibility) page to ensure you're using a supported version.
</Step>

<Step title="Update if necessary">
If your version is outdated, update to the latest compatible version:

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npm install @fhenixprotocol/cofhe-contracts@latest
```

```bash yarn
yarn add @fhenixprotocol/cofhe-contracts@latest
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm add @fhenixprotocol/cofhe-contracts@latest
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
This section will be expanded over time as new issues arise. If you encounter an issue not documented here, please report it to the Fhenix team.

## Possible Errors from Solidity

The following table lists common Solidity errors you may encounter when working with CoFHE contracts. Each error includes a description to help you understand what went wrong and how to fix it.

| Error | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **InvalidInputsAmount** | Operation requires a specific number of inputs. Occurs when an operation receives the wrong number of arguments |
| **InvalidOperationInputs** | Operation inputs must be valid for the operation. Thrown when inputs violate operation requirements |
| **TooManyInputs** | Operations have maximum input limits. Error when input count exceeds the operation's maximum |
| **InvalidBytesLength** | Byte arrays must match expected length. Occurs when byte array length doesn't match the required size |
| **InvalidTypeOrSecurityZone** | Operations must use compatible types and security zones. Occurs when an operation violates type or security zone constraints |
| **InvalidInputType** | Input must match the expected type. Error when input type doesn't match function requirements |
| **InvalidInputForFunction** | Function inputs must match defined parameters. Thrown when a function receives an incompatible input type |
| **InvalidSecurityZone** | Operations must stay within defined security zones. Error when an operation violates security zone constraints |
| **InvalidSignature** | Cryptographic signatures must be valid. Occurs with signature verification failures |
| **InvalidSigner** | Signer must match the expected authorized address. Error when transaction signer doesn't match the required address |
| **InvalidAddress** | Address must be valid and non-zero. Error when an invalid address is provided |
| **OnlyOwnerAllowed** | Function restricted to contract owner. Error includes the address of the unauthorized caller |
| **OnlyAggregatorAllowed** | Function restricted to authorized aggregator. Error includes the address of the unauthorized caller |
| **AlreadyDelegated** | Delegatee contract is already a delegatee for sender and delegator addresses. Error when attempting duplicate delegation |
| **SenderCannotBeDelegateeAddress** | Sender cannot be the delegatee address. Error when sender tries to delegate to themselves |
| **SenderNotAllowed** | Sender address not authorized for allow operations. Error includes the address of the unauthorized sender |
| **DirectAllowForbidden** | Direct handle allowance not permitted. Must use Task Manager. Error includes the address attempting direct allow |

### Understanding Error Types

**Input Validation Errors:**
- `InvalidInputsAmount`, `InvalidOperationInputs`, `TooManyInputs`, `InvalidBytesLength`
- These errors indicate problems with how data is passed to FHE operations
- **Solution**: Verify that you're passing the correct number and type of arguments

**Type and Security Zone Errors:**
- `InvalidTypeOrSecurityZone`, `InvalidInputType`, `InvalidInputForFunction`, `InvalidSecurityZone`
- These errors occur when encrypted types don't match expected types or security zones
- **Solution**: Ensure encrypted values use compatible types (e.g., `euint32` matches `euint32`) and are in the correct security zone

**Authentication Errors:**
- `InvalidSignature`, `InvalidSigner`, `InvalidAddress`
- These errors relate to cryptographic verification and address validation
- **Solution**: Verify signatures are valid and addresses are properly formatted

**Authorization Errors:**
- `OnlyOwnerAllowed`, `OnlyAggregatorAllowed`, `SenderNotAllowed`, `DirectAllowForbidden`
- These errors indicate permission or access control violations
- **Solution**: Ensure the correct account is calling the function and that proper permissions are set

**Delegation Errors:**
- `AlreadyDelegated`, `SenderCannotBeDelegateeAddress`
- These errors occur when delegation operations are invalid
- **Solution**: Check that delegation hasn't already occurred and that sender and delegatee addresses are different

## Troubleshooting Tips

When encountering errors:

1. **Check error messages carefully**: The error name and description provide clues about what went wrong
2. **Verify input types**: Ensure encrypted values match expected types
3. **Check permissions**: Verify that `FHE.allowThis()` or `FHE.allowSender()` have been called where necessary
4. **Review component versions**: Ensure all CoFHE components are up to date
5. **Test in mock environment**: Use the mock environment to debug issues without network delays

<Tip>
Many errors can be prevented by following [best practices](/fhe-library/introduction/best-practices) and ensuring proper access control management.
</Tip>

## Next Steps

- Review the [Compatibility](/get-started/introduction/compatibility) page for version requirements
- Learn about [access control](/fhe-library/core-concepts/access-control) to prevent authorization errors
- Check [best practices](/fhe-library/introduction/best-practices) for secure FHE development
- Explore the [API reference](/api-reference/introduction) for detailed function documentation
