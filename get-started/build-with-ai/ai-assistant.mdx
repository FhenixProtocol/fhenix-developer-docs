> **AI Training Materials for Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) Smart Contract Development using Fhenix**

NEO is a comprehensive training resource that helps you transform AI assistants (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.) into expert FHE developers. By loading NEO's reference materials into your AI assistant, you'll get expert-level guidance on building confidential smart contracts with Fhenix.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone or Access the Repository**

   Visit the [FHE Assistant repository](https://github.com/marronjo/fhe-assistant) on GitHub

2. **Load Core.md into Your AI**

   Copy the contents of `core.md` into your AI assistant's context window

3. **Start Building**

   Use the proven prompts above to generate FHE-compatible smart contracts


### Loading into AI Platforms

**Claude Code:**

```
claude "Read the fhe-assistant/core.md file and help me build FHE smart contracts using these patterns"
```

**Other AI Platforms (ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.):**

Copy-paste the `core.md` file and say: _"This is FHE reference material. Help me build encrypted smart contracts."_


## Proven AI Prompts

Once you've loaded NEO's reference materials, try these proven prompts:

### Code Generation

* _"Build me a [voting/auction/gaming] contract using FHE patterns"_
* _"Create an encrypted token with private balances"_

### Code Review

* _"Review this FHE contract against the security checklist"_
* _"Fix this contract that has FHE access control errors"_

### Learning

* _"Explain FHE access control and show me working examples"_
* _"Why can't I use ebool in if statements? Show me the right way"_

## What's Inside

The NEO repository includes:

**📚 `core.md`** → Comprehensive FHE library reference (EVERYTHING YOU NEED)

**📖 `README.md`** → Quick start guide

### Core.md Contents

The comprehensive reference file includes:

* 🔢 **All encrypted data types** - ebool, euint8-128, eaddress
* ➕ **Complete operation reference** - Arithmetic, comparison, logical operations
* 🔐 **Access control patterns** - FHE.allow*, critical for security
* 🔄 **Conditional operations** - FHE.select - the only way to use ebool
* 🔓 **Decryption workflows** - Multi-transaction patterns
* 🚨 **Common mistakes** - Debugging guide and pitfalls to avoid
* ✅ **Working code templates** - Ready-to-use examples

## Why Use NEO?

Building with FHE requires understanding specific patterns and security considerations that differ from standard Solidity development. NEO provides:

* **Complete Reference** - All FHE types and operations in one place
* **Security Patterns** - Access control and encryption best practices
* **Working Examples** - Real code templates you can use immediately
* **Common Pitfalls** - Learn from mistakes others have made
* **Fhenix-Specific** - All patterns target Fhenix protocol directly
