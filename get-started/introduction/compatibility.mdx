## Overview

This document provides detailed compatibility information for all components in the CoFHE ecosystem. Following these version requirements is crucial for maintaining a stable and secure development environment.

<Warning>
Using incompatible versions of CoFHE components can lead to unexpected behavior, security vulnerabilities, or complete failure of your application. Always verify version compatibility before deployment.
</Warning>

## Core Components

The following table lists all core CoFHE components with their current and minimum compatible versions:

| Component | Current Version | Minimum Compatible Version | Notes |
|-----------|----------------|----------------------------|-------|
| **cofhe-contracts** | [`0.0.13`](https://github.com/FhenixProtocol/cofhe-contracts/tree/v0.0.13) ([abi](https://cofhe-docs.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/v0.0.13/index.html)) | [`0.0.13`](https://github.com/FhenixProtocol/cofhe-contracts/tree/v0.0.13) ([abi](https://cofhe-docs.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/v0.0.13/index.html)) | Solidity libraries and smart contracts for FHE operations |
| **Cofhejs** | [`0.3.1`](https://github.com/FhenixProtocol/cofhejs/releases/tag/v0.3.1) | [`0.2.1-alpha.1`](https://github.com/FhenixProtocol/cofhejs/releases/tag/v0.2.1-alpha.1) | JavaScript library for interacting with FHE contracts and the CoFHE coprocessor |
| **cofhe-mock-contracts** | [`0.3.1`](https://github.com/FhenixProtocol/cofhe-mock-contracts/releases/tag/v0.3.1) | [`0.2.1-alpha.3`](https://github.com/FhenixProtocol/cofhe-mock-contracts/releases/tag/v0.2.1-alpha.3) | Solidity contracts that mimic CoFHE off-chain behavior |
| **cofhe-hardhat-plugin** | [`0.3.1`](https://github.com/FhenixProtocol/cofhe-hardhat-plugin/releases/tag/v0.3.1) | [`0.2.1-alpha.3`](https://github.com/FhenixProtocol/cofhe-hardhat-plugin/releases/tag/v0.2.1-alpha.3) | Hardhat plugin that deploys the cofhe-mock-contracts and exposes utilities |

### Version Compatibility Guidelines

When working with CoFHE components:

- **Always use the latest stable versions**: Check GitHub releases for the most recent versions
- **Verify compatibility**: Ensure all components are within their compatible version ranges
- **Test thoroughly**: After updating versions, test your application in both mock and testnet environments
- **Check release notes**: Review breaking changes and migration guides when upgrading

<Tip>
For the best development experience, use the latest versions of all components. They are designed to work together seamlessly and include the latest features and security improvements.
</Tip>

## Network Compatibility

CoFHE currently supports the following networks:

| Network | Compatible | API Version | Notes | Plugin Name |
|---------|------------|-------------|-------|-------------|
| **Sepolia** | ✅ | `v1` | Full support | `eth-sepolia` |
| **Arbitrum Sepolia** | ✅ | `v1` | Full support | `arb-sepolia` |
| **Base Sepolia** | ✅ | `v1` | Full support | `base-sepolia` |

<Info>
All supported networks use API version `v1`. The plugin names correspond to the network identifiers used in Hardhat configuration files.
</Info>


## Troubleshooting Compatibility Issues

If you encounter compatibility issues:

1. **Verify all versions**: Ensure all CoFHE components are using compatible versions
2. **Check network support**: Confirm your target network is supported
3. **Review error messages**: Look for version mismatch errors in your console
4. **Update dependencies**: Run `npm update` or `yarn upgrade` to get the latest compatible versions
5. **Check documentation**: Review the component-specific documentation for version requirements

<Warning>
If you're experiencing issues after updating versions, check the release notes for breaking changes and migration guides. Some updates may require code changes in your contracts or client applications.
